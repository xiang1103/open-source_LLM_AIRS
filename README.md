# open-source_LLM_AIRS
Deployed open source LLMs for AIRS Lab usage. We will implement a general LLM, and a more task specific model, and a reasoning model (if we can find small enough).  

## Models 
- [ ] [DeepSeek V3](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324) (General LLM)
- [ ] [DeepSeek R1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1)    (Reasoning)
